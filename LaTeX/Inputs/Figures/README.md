# Figures for the paper can be generated using either the HARK toolkit and ipython.

## Python and HARK

The figures produced by the python code are in the `Code/Python/Figures` directory

To generate the figures:
See [Econ-ARK/HARK](https://hark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#Installing-HARK) for instructions for installing the 
toolkit. Once it is installed, change to the Code/Python directory and generate the figures using either of these methods:

1. Using ipython
   * From a command line, execute `ipython PortfolioChoiceWithRiskyHousing.py`
1. Open `PortfolioChoiceWithRiskyHousing.ipynb` using a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)
