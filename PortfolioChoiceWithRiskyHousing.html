  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1  </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Economists have long sought to use models of mathematically optimal behavior
to try to understand saving and investment decisions over a household’s
life-cycle<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="PortfolioChoiceWithRiskyHousing2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>  .
If there were no uncertainty (about, say, investment returns), calculating optimal choices
would not be hard. For example, consumers would want to invest their whole ﬁnancial
portfolio in whatever asset they knew (in advance) would yield the highest rate of
return.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  But in the real world, assets that – on average – yield higher returns (like stocks), also are
much riskier than low-return safe assets (like bank deposits). Aversion to risk is a
perfectly rational motivation, so how much to invest in risky versus safe assets is far
from obvious. Furthermore, there are many other risks (to job, health, to house
prices, and more) that should further temper any rational person’s appetite for risky
investment.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  As noted in <a 
href="#XCarroll2020">Carroll</a> (<a 
href="#XCarroll2020">2020</a>)<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="PortfolioChoiceWithRiskyHousing3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1002f2"></a>  ,
calculating truly optimal behavior in a realistically uncertain world is such a diﬃcult challenge
that only recently has it become feasible to do with a reasonably high degree of realism.
Rational choice models like the one we examined there must account for many important
features of reality, including diﬀerent types of uncertainty (labor income risk, mortality risk,
and stock market risk), and should allow for reasonable choices of risk aversion, impatience,
and other preferences. They need properly to account for for the path of income over the life
cycle and into retirement, eﬀects of aging and mortality, interest rates and economic growth,
and myriad other factors.
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  All of this is so diﬃcult that professional ﬁnancial advisors do not attempt it, relying
instead on rules of thumb and intuition to guide their clients. Indeed, despite the current
excitement about the wonders of artiﬁcial intelligence, even online “robo-advisors” do not
incorporate the degree of realism described above. Serious mathematical optimization eﬀorts
have been restricted to the pages of top academic economics journals – and the associated
computer code used to solve the models in those papers has been so impenetrable as to be
unusable.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >  <a 
href="#XCarroll2020">Carroll</a> (<a 
href="#XCarroll2020">2020</a>) described the ﬁrst phase of our work sponsored by TFI in building a public,
easy-to-use, open-source software toolkit of the computer code that can solve these kinds of
problems. We showed that our free tools are able easily and quickly to reproduce the results
that have been published in the academic literature.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >  However, as noted in <a 
href="#XCarroll2020">Carroll</a> (<a 
href="#XCarroll2020">2020</a>), those models of optimal decisionmaking imply that,
given the robust rate of return that risky assets (’stocks’) have earned in the past, most
consumers should invest <span 
class="ecti-1200">all </span>of their ﬁnancial wealth in stocks over most of their
lifetimes.
<!--l. 2--><p class="indent" >  A tempting interpretation of the discrepancy between the models’ predictions and people’s
actual choices is that most people are just making a mistake in not investing more
in stocks. Another possibility, though, is that the models are still missing some
vitally important (and rational) factor that weighs on people’s actual decisions;
in this case, people might be making rational decisions and the models might be
wrong.
<!--l. 4--><p class="indent" >  There’s an obvious candidate for the missing factor. For most households homeownership is
the biggest ﬁnancial decision in their lives. Homeownership <span 
class="ecti-1200">should </span>matter for consumers’
choices about how willing they should rationally be to expose themselves to risky ﬁnancial
assets, for at least two reasons. First, homeownership exposes consumers to housing market
price risk, which should have the eﬀect of reducing their appetite for being exposed
to other kinds of risk. Second, homeownership is associated with certain payment
obligations (not just mortgages, but property taxes, maintenance costs, and so on), which
reduces the ﬂexibility they may have in adjusting their spending in response to income
ﬂuctuations.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  These points may seem obvious, but there is a good reason they have not been incorporated
in previous analyses of households’ optimal choice: Taking account of these complexities
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
greatly increases the computational diﬃculty of calculating optimal decisions. This technical
report describes results obtained using the latest tools to be added to the <a 
href="https://econ-ark.org/" >Econ-ARK</a> toolkit;
with these tools, it should be much easier for economists, ﬁnancial planners, and others to
understand the appropriate role of homeownership in modifying investors’ optimal saving and
ﬁnancial choices.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2  </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Literature Review</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Beginning with <a 
href="#XMerton1969">Merton</a> (<a 
href="#XMerton1969">1969</a>) and <a 
href="#XSamuelson1969">Samuelson</a> (<a 
href="#XSamuelson1969">1969</a>), there is an extensive literature on
portfolio choice over the life-cycle. <a 
href="#XCocco2005">Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout</a> (<a 
href="#XCocco2005">2005</a>) develop a
model of portfolio choice under incomplete markets and with labor income risk
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="PortfolioChoiceWithRiskyHousing4.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f3"></a> .
Although they are successful in solving a realistically calibrated life-cycle portfolio choice
model, their results imply that most households, and in particular young households with low
liquid wealth should invest <span 
class="ecti-1200">all </span>of their assets in the stock market. In reality, however, people
choose a degree of stock market participation and risky share of assets much lower than
what the model proposes would be optimal even for a person with very high risk
aversion<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="PortfolioChoiceWithRiskyHousing5.html#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f4"></a>  .
This gap between observed and actual stock market participation is known as the stock
market participation puzzle, and it remains an open question that is not explained by
state-of-the-art quantitative life-cycle models.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  One possible explanation for the stock market participation puzzle could be the absence of
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
additional forms of asset holding and risk exposure that households face. In particular,
housing has dual properties: Both as an asset and as a source of consumption services .
Housing, however, is diﬀerent from other assets in that it is illiquid and durable,
providing both future expected wealth (house value of liquidation) as well as shelter
as a consumption service. <a 
href="#XChetty2017">CHETTY, SÁNDOR, and SZEIDL</a> (<a 
href="#XChetty2017">2017</a>) empirically
quantify the eﬀect of housing on portfolio choice. Looking at the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP) panel from 1990 to 2008, the authors establish the
importance of property value and home equity (value minus mortgage debt) on stock
market participation. Importantly, they ﬁnd that a $10,000 increase in mortgage debt
(holding home equity constant) causes the risky portfolio share to decrease by 0.6
percentage points or $275, which amounts to 3.9% of mean stockholdings in their
data. Importantly for our purposes, they establish the need to distinguish the eﬀects
of home equity and mortgage debt in order to quantify the eﬀect of housing on
portfolios.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  This project builds a quantitative model of housing and portfolio choice that can be used to
interpret the empirical ﬁndings <a 
href="#XChetty2017">CHETTY, SÁNDOR, and SZEIDL</a> (<a 
href="#XChetty2017">2017</a>) in a rich
framework that includes liquid wealth, illiquid housing (size and value), and mortgage debt, in
order to capture the eﬀects of home equity and mortgage debt on portfolio choice. While other
recent work has attempted to shed light on this topic, this model is the ﬁrst of its kind to
explicitly track home value and mortgage debt separately, allowing them each to evolve with
the decisionmaker’s choices and with economic shocks (say, to house prices). The 2-period
model <a 
href="#XChetty2017">CHETTY, SÁNDOR, and SZEIDL</a> (<a 
href="#XChetty2017">2017</a>) develop misses the life-cycle properties of
housing choice and income risk. Additionally, although their empirical ﬁndings reveal the
importance of distinguishing home equity and mortgage debt, their model does not
allow these variables to be chosen. <a 
href="#XCocco2004rfs">Cocco</a> (<a 
href="#XCocco2004rfs">2005</a>) and <a 
href="#Xyao2005optimal">Yao and Zhang</a> (<a 
href="#Xyao2005optimal">2005</a>) do
allow choice of house size but do not distinguish between home equity and mortgage
debt, instead only keeping track of net wealth as the total value of assets minus
liabilities.

<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >When modeling housing decisions, diﬀerent assumptions can be made about the “sizes” of
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
houses that are available for people’s use. The “size” of a house is used to represent a scale of
the diﬀerent levels of utility that diﬀerent houses yield, so a “big” house is simply a house that
yields more utility than a “small” house. This section explores how the literature has dealt
with the questions
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">What  kind  of  houses  can  people  buy?  Is  there  a  ﬁnite  number  of  types  or  a

      <li class="itemize">Can people change the size of their house without moving to a diﬀerent house? are
      these changes continuous or lumpy? Are they decisions or are they mechanically
      tied to other life-cycle characteristics like permanent income?

      <li class="itemize">Do houses depreciate over time? Can this depreciation be oﬀset?</li></ul>

forces the agent to sell his house, liquidate his mortgage and exit the model.There is no
depreciation or associated costs.

can switch homes at any time but this entails a monetary cost that is proportional to the

spend that period in a rented house.

diﬀerent sizes (and therefore costs), but they are generally an expensive asset whose value is at
least a few times the household’s yearly income. Young households usually cannot buy their
houses outright, as they start with little to no assets and take time to accumulate enough
resources. They therefore usually rely on mortgages to purchase their houses. These young and
leveraged households might thus be sensitive to stock market risk, causing them to reduce
their stock market participation.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  During the repayment period, households’ market resources (or liquid assets) are reduced by
at least the ﬁxed mortgage payment. This has two eﬀects on risky asset choice: 1) It reduces
’market resources’ (current income, plus current non-housing wealth) today, making
households relatively less wealthy, and 2) It reduces market resources in following
periods for any given level of current savings, making households more risk averse due
to the precautionary motive. The ﬁxed nature of mortgage payments has another
important eﬀect: since the household must be sure to have suﬃcient resources in the
next period to pay their mortgage and the cost of house maintenance, they might
want to save more of their resources in a safe account rather than in the risky stock
market.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Houses are also subject to price ﬂuctuations that depend on local housing market conditions
as well as broader national trends, such as recessions and expansions. The uncertain sale price
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
of your house, then, constitutes additional uncertainty in future net worth and could thus have
signiﬁcant implications for portfolio decisions. One way to think about this is to realize that
the owner of a house has an implicit holding of a risky asset, which should motivate them to
want to reduce their exposure to additional risk in another risky asset, the stock
market.

<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁrst stage of the model consists of young households making a decision to buy
a house of ﬁxed size. Importantly, young households have little to no assets and
have recently joined the labor market, which means their income is also relatively
small. In order to ﬁnance a home, then, young households must choose a house of a
particular value and a corresponding mortgage size. Lenders are assumed to impose some
microprudential conditions such as loan-to-income ratios to ensure that mortgages are
repayable.

<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >Once households choose a house and mortgage, they commit to ﬁxed-rate payments for the
rest of their working life, which is about 30 years. During this time, households have an

which may lead them to reduce their exposure to other risky assets, such as the stock
market.

accumulated savings, making them signiﬁcantly wealthier (where wealth here refers to their

experience a risk of house liquidation due to the possibility of being forced to move
out due to poor health or old age. If they are forced to sell, they do so at their
local housing market prices; the value of the house gets transformed into liquid
wealth.

wealth is tied up in an illiquid asset have more risk appetite the larger the proportion of home
equity to net wealth is.

risky share is equal to 1 at least up to the point where their liquid wealth is equal to their

not the only eﬀect. A larger house also reduces the rate at which the risky share

<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  The volatility of the housing market can have strong implications for the portfolio decisions
of households who own their houses. A higher standard deviation in house prices implies a
larger implicit holding of a risky asset (the house), regardless of house size. For this reason,
households would optimally choose to avoid risk in other risky assets. As we see in ﬁgure <a

2 households who have a house of equal size, the risky share of a household in a more volatile

<!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >  As mentioned before, a house represents an implicit holding in a risky market that is
otherwise uncorrelated with the stock market. A larger house, however, provides a higher
expected value of house liquidation which also means a higher expected future liquid wealth.
Households with more valuable homes, then, have a higher absolute risk tolerance because
their future housing value constitutes a buﬀer stock of wealth; thus they invest more
resources in the risky asset market than they would if they had smaller homes.
In ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-130015">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:liquidAssetsByHouse --></a> we see that for an initial level of liquid assets, households of diﬀerent
house sizes invest the same amount of total assets in the stock market; this is the
region where their risky share is 100%. Past this region, we see that households
with a bigger house (and thus more home equity) are willing to invest a greater
share of their liquid assets than peers with the same amount of liquid assets but less
home equity. This indicates that home equity increases the level of risk appetite for
households.
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4  </span> <a 
 id="x1-140005.4"></a>House size crowds out investment</h4>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >However, when comparing households on a total wealth basis, i.e. their liquid assets plus
expected house liquidation, we can see that house size crowds out investment for households
with low liquid wealth. In ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-140016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:liquidAssetsByEquity --></a>, we can consider a household whose house size is
equal to 5 (5 times their yearly net income) and liquid assets are 0, so their total
expected wealth is 5. As this household becomes wealthier, they invest all of their
liquid assets in the stock market (such that their risky share is 100 percent), up to
the point where they start rebalancing their portfolio between the risky and the
safe asset. In this region, they are constrained from investing in the stock market
by their low liquid wealth, as they surely would like to invest more in the market.
This point becomes clearer by comparing the household to an equally wealthy peer
with a smaller house. At the point where the household with house size of 5 has
liquid wealth of 1 (1 times their yearly net income), they are investing less into the
stock market in absolute terms than an equally wealthy household whose house size

wealth increases, however, both households are unconstrained by their house size

their consumption horizon gets shorter and the likelihood that they receive a windfall of
wealth from their house liquidation increases.

 id="x1-160006"></a>Conclusions</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Most people who need advice about how to invest in ﬁnancial markets are also homeowners.
But until now, even the most sophisticated and realistic analyses of how people should
optimally invest in ﬁnancial markets have not accounted for the (undeniably important)
ramiﬁcations of homeownership for their ﬁnancial choices.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  That’s because constructing a model that correctly tracks all the potential interactions
between homeownership, ﬁnancial risk, and other kinds of risk is remarkably diﬃcult. This
report describes a free, publicly available open-source software tool that does these complex
calculations. Sponsorship by the Think Forward Initiative has allowed us to add this tool to
the free, open-source, <a 
href="https://econ-ark.org" >Econ-ARK</a> toolkit, thus making it available to ﬁnancial institutions,
ﬁnancial planners, robo-advisors, academics, and anyone else who might be interested in a
rigorous analysis of these questions.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Despite their combinatorial complexity, the answers that come from the model make
intuitive sense. A ﬁrst conclusion is that greater uncertainty about future house prices should
make you less willing to invest in the stock market. In other words, a homeowner who
lives in a place with wild house-price swings will ﬁnd it best to have less exposure
to other kinds of risk (like stock market risk) than someone with circumstances
that are otherwise similar, but who lives in a place where house prices are more
stable.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Another conclusion might seem to push in the other direction, but really does not:
Among homeowners whose mortgage is paid oﬀ, for a given level of <span 
class="ecti-1200">nonhousing </span>net
worth (say, $200K of ﬁnancial assets net of mortgage debt), a person whose house is
more valuable should invest more in risky ﬁnancial asset. The reason is simple: For
a given amount of liquid assets, the person with a bigger house is richer, and a
richer person will want to have more money (in absolute terms) invested in the stock
market).
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  The ﬁnal point is that the existence of homeownership does not reverse one of the more
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
surprising implications of the baseline model without homeownership: The richer you are, the
lower is the optimal share of your portfolio in risky assets. This implication of the model does
not match the available data well. The conclusion is easy to reverse by introducing a bequest
motive in which bequests are a luxury good; but how exactly such a motive should be
constructed is by no means a settled question, either among ﬁnancial planners or
among academic researchers. It is a topic we hope to address in future releases of our
toolkit.
